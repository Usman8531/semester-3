1. Waterfall Model : 
It requires a well understanding and knowledge of requirements and technology related to it. 

Advantages : 
 


It is very easy and convenient to implement the waterfall model.
For implementation of small systems, it is very useful.
Disadvantages : 
 

It may cause some confusion if some of the changes are made at some phases.
Firstly, the requirement analysis is done and in the beginning, sometimes it is not possible to state all the requirements explicitly.
Only at the end, the customer can see the working model of the project.
Linear nature of the waterfall model induces blocking states.

2. Spiral Model : 
It is developed in iterations and used for risk management. Hence, at new iterations, the requirements can be recognized. 

Advantages : 
 

By construction of prototype, the working model of the system can be designed quickly.
During the development stage, Project can be refined by developer and user.
Involvement of user in the project.
It is very Cost-effective and easy to maintain.
Risk analysis and reduction can be done systematically and in a proper manner.
Well planned and efficient project development.
Disadvantages : 
 

In series of increments, Software gets developed.
If communication with customer is not well or proper then it results in total project failure or non-success or project that might leads to omission of the project.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Incremental Model : 
It is a process of software development and focuses on short successive iterations. 

Advantages : 
 

If less number of people are available for project development, then this model is very useful.
Technical risks can be managed effectively and in a well-organized manner.
The core or final product can be shown to the customer within a small duration of time.
Disadvantages : 
 

Highly and fully committed developers and customers are required for this project.
Adopting new technologies and developing the project using this model is very difficult and problematic.
Heavy resources can be required.

4: Sequential V-model:
Advantages of V-model:

Simple and easy to use.
Testing activities like planning, test designing happens well before coding. This saves a lot of time. Hence higher chance of success over the waterfall model.
Proactive defect tracking â€“ that is defects are found at early stage.
Avoids the downward flow of the defects.
Works well for small projects where requirements are easily understood.
Disadvantages of V-model:

Very rigid and least flexible.
Software is developed during the implementation phase, so no early prototypes of the software are produced.
If any changes happen in midway, then the test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5: Prototype Model
Advantages of using Prototype Model :

This model is flexible in design.
It is easy to detect errors.
We can find missing functionality easily.
There is scope of refinement, it means new requirements can be easily accommodated.
It can be reused by the developer for more complicated projects in the future.
It ensures a greater level of customer satisfaction and comfort.
It is ideal for online system.
It helps developers and users both understand the system better.
Integration requirements are very well understood and deployment channels are decided at a very early stage.
It can actively involve users in the development phase.
Disadvantages of using Prototype Model :

This model is costly.
It has poor documentation because of continuously changing customer requirements.
There may be too much variation in requirements.
Customers sometimes demand the actual product to be delivered soon after seeing an early prototype.
There may be sub-optimal solutions because of developers in a hurry to build prototypes.
Customers may not be satisfied or interested in the product after seeing the initial prototype.
There is certainty in determining the number of iterations.
There may be incomplete or inadequate problem analysis.
There may increase the complexity of the system.
